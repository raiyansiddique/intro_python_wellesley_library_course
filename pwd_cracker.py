# Write a Python script that uses the random library to generate 
# random character combinations and simulate keyboard inputs. 
# The script prompts the user for a password, and then uses a while loop to 
# generate random character combinations until the correct password is found. 
# The generated password is compared to the user's input password using a list comparison,
# and if a match is found, the script prints the password to the console. c
